notes on what i would like to do with APL

This is a placeholder for an actual APL project.  Here is what I would like to do:

Start a github org for APL-stuff (choose a better name).  Then mirror all of the free and open source APL implementations into this org.
Include a font, and any sort of config required to INPUT apl characters, and display apl characters in whatever editor I am using.


The end goal being merely to get a working APL environment running, and to understand the one line APL:

    life←{↑ 1 ⍵ ∨.^3 4=+/,¯1 0 1∘.⊖¯1 0 1∘.⌽ ⊂ ⍵ }
